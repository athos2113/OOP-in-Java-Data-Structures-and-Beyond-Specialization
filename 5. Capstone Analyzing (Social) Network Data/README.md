About this Course:
>In this capstone project we’ll combine  all of the skills from all four specialization courses to do something really fun: analyze social networks!  

The opportunities for learning are practically endless in a social network.  Who are the “influential” members of the network?  What are the sub-communities in the network?   Who is connected to whom, and by how many links?   These are just some of the questions you can explore in this project.

We will provide you with a real-world data set and some infrastructure for getting started, as well as some warm up tasks and basic project requirements, but then it’ll be up to you where you want to take the project.  If you’re running short on ideas, we’ll have several suggested directions that can help get your creativity and imagination going.  Finally, to integrate the skills you acquired in course 4 (and to show off your project!) you will be asked to create a video showcase of your final product.

## After completing this course, you will be able to...
1. Independently implement a Java project of significant size.
2. Pose questions that can be answered with social network data.
3. Develop or find/select algorithms to answer these questions.
4. Make software design decisions.
5. Describe a technical project both through written reports and oral presentations.
6. Review others’ code design and oral presentation.
7. Analyze algorithms to assess their appropriateness for solving a given problem on real-world data.
8. Iterate a design to improve style and efficiency.


## Project Overview
In this capstone project you will explore social network data, completing a project where you work with graphs and other data structures you’ve learned in previous courses in this specialization, while applying at least one new algorithm to solve a problem of your choosing.

Social network data is all around us, and is easily represented as a graph. For example, if you think about your friend network on Facebook, each person can be represented as a node in the graph, and each friendship connection can be represented as an undirected edge between the nodes containing the people involved in the friendship. Twitter can be represented similarly, but with directed edges since following someone is a one-way relationship (you can follow someone without them following you back).

Using this graph abstraction, we can answer many interesting questions about the data underlying the graph. For example, we can automatically discover communities in a social network; we can recommend that people connect as friends based on the structure of their mutual acquaintances in the graph; we can figure out who the “influencers” are; and, we can look at how information might travel within and across groups.

In this capstone project, you will explore some of these issues. Which questions you answer and which properties you consider will largely be up to you: we’re looking for creativity and personal expression. We’ll provide you with some support, but where you go with it is up to you and we look forward to seeing what you uncover in the world of social network data!



Here is an overview of the assignments in each week to help you get a sense of the project and plan your time:

### Week 1:
Warm up assignment (required, auto-graded) In this first assignment you will start to work with some real-world social network data and implement some graph algorithms to help you warm up and dive back into data structures and Java programming.  

## Week 2:
Project scope and definition (required, peer-graded) In this second week you will define the scope of your project. This assignment will involve selecting a data set, determining what questions you will ask about your data, finding or developing the data structures and algorithms to answer those questions, and doing a preliminary analysis of the running time of these algorithms.  

## Week 3:
Mini-project and report (optional, peer graded) One of the questions you will pick in Week 2 to ask about your data set is required to be relatively easy to answer. This will allow you to go through the "full cycle" of the capstone project from question formulation to implementation to report and get some early feedback on each of these components, before you repeat the process on a more challenging question and algorithm. In this week, you'll do this first "full cycle".  

## Week 4:
Main project checkpoint (optional, peer graded) In week 4 you should be well into the investigations of the questions you laid out in week 2, and you should have already gotten some feedback from your peers about the scope of your projects which you will be using to guide and refine your work. This week you have the option to report on your progress and again get guidance from your peers to ensure that you will pass the main report assignment in week 5.  

## Week 5:
Main project report (required, peer graded) In week 5 you will complete the implementation of your project and submit your code and a final written report (including an analysis of your algorithm(s)) for peer review. You will also perform peer review on your peers' submitted project reports.  

## Week 6:
Oral project report (required, peer graded) In week 6 you will complete an assignment very similar to the assignment you completed in week 3 of our course on Mastering the Software Engineering Interview. We will ask you to submit a video in which you give an oral presentation addressing specific aspects of your project. You will also perform peer review on your peers' submitted oral presentations.
